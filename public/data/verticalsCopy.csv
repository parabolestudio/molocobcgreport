Travel,"OTAs, digital aggregators for hotels, activities and digital travel utilities","Tripadvisor, Booking, CityMapper, Airbnb, Expedia","Travel faces one of the highest disruption risks across all verticals, with AI collapsing the entire journey from inspiration to booking into single conversational flows. 

With minimal customer loyalty and heavy reliance on search channels that AI now owns, OTAs risk becoming invisible data suppliers.

Gaming,"Mobile games across casual, mid-core and social formats","Roblox, Candy Crush, Monopoly Go, Pokemon Go, Royal Match","Mobile Gaming enjoys some protection from service disruption but relatively weak loyalty creates some vulnerability from discovery disruption. 

While AI cannot replicate gameplay or live operations, moderate retention and paid-heavy acquisition leave gaming exposed as discovery channels shift. App-native engagement provides defense, but without stronger retention mechanics, user acquisition costs may climb.","AI is great for speeding up creative iterations, but it doesn't replace the actual game or the player experience—those come from years of development, IP, and live-ops.","Product Marketing Director, Leading Gaming Publisher","Compared to other industries, gaming has a lower risk of AI taking over the service, because the unique value is the proprietary pool of IP, player data, and communities that only publishers control.","Partnerships Director, Leading AI Company","If I want direct, immediate access and visuals of the games, I'll just go to the App Store.
